## 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm a fullstack software engineer focused on building powerful, production-ready **mobile apps** using **Flutter** and **Golang**. My work is all about merging premium UI with scalable backend systems—delivering real products, not just pretty screens.

I don’t build for hype. I build for results. Whether it's creating accountability tools like **Nudgr**, writing dev-focused articles, or refining my backend architecture skills with Go—I'm always moving with intent.

I believe in:
- Code that’s clean, scalable, and made to last.
- Mobile-first thinking, always.
- Documenting the journey—because someone else needs the roadmap.
