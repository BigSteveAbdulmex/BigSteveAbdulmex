# Hey, Iâ€™m Stephen Abdulmex ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a Software Engineer hooked on building mobile apps with **Flutter** and solid backends with **Go**. I love creating apps that feel great to use and systems that work.

## About Me
Iâ€™m all about coding apps from the ground up, crushing bugs, and making things run fast. I keep my code clean, test it thoroughly, and leave clear notes for others (or future me). Building apps that click with users is my jam. ðŸ˜Ž

## What I Work With
- **Languages**: Dart, Go
- **Mobile**: Flutter for Android/iOS, custom UI, BLoC, Riverpod, Provider
- **Backend**: Go APIs (Fiber, Gin), PostgreSQL, Docker
- **Tools**: Firebase, Git, REST APIs, unit & widget testing
