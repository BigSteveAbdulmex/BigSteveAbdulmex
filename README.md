# Hey, Iâ€™m Steve Abdulmex ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a Full-Stack Software Engineer who loves building mobile apps with Flutter and solid backends with Golang. My goal is to create apps that work smoothly and solve real problems for users.

## About Me
I enjoy turning ideas into working apps, from building the user interface to setting up the backend that keeps everything running. Whether itâ€™s tweaking an appâ€™s layout to feel just right or making sure the server can handle a ton of users, Iâ€™m all about getting the details right. I take pride in writing code thatâ€™s easy to understand, testing thoroughly, and leaving clear notes for anyone who picks up my work.

Iâ€™m big on:
- Writing clean, organized code thatâ€™s easy to maintain.
- Building apps that feel great to use, especially on phones.
- Documenting my work so others (or future me) can follow along.

- Golang for backend systems

### Mobile App Skills
