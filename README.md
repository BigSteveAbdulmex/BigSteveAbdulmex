# Hey, Iâ€™m Steve Abdulmex ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a Software Engineer who loves building mobile apps with Flutter and backends with Go. I focus on creating apps that users enjoy and systems that run smoothly.

## About Me
I enjoy coding apps from scratch, squashing bugs, and keeping things fast. I write clean code, test thoroughly, and leave clear notes for others (or future me). Iâ€™m all about learning new tech and connecting with devs.

## What I Work With
- **Languages**: Dart, Go
- **Mobile**: Flutter for Android/iOS, custom UI, BLoC, Riverpod, Provider
- **Backend**: Go APIs (Fiber, Gin), PostgreSQL, Docker
- **Tools**: Firebase, Git, REST APIs, unit & widget testing
